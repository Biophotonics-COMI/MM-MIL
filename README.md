# Mix-and-Match Multiple Instance Learning (MM-MIL)
This is the code repository for our paper: Weakly supervised identification of microscopic human breast cancer-related optical signatures from normal-appearing breast tissue [https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.480687].

## Overview
We propose MM-MIL for the discovery of novel optical signatures when only coarse-grained and ambiguous annotations are available. We applied the proposed method to the investigation of human breast cancer-related optical signatures based on Simultaneous Label-free Autofluorescence Multiharmonic (SLAM) microscopy and unveiled non-obvious cancer-related optical signatures in peri-tumoral regions.
